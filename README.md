# sido

*sido (시도)* meaning : Try/attempt

A very simple PHP unit testing library I created as I'm not a fan of PHPUnit and it's many dependencies.

## Installation

```bash
composer require eddiejibson/sido:dev-master
```

## Why sido?

* Simple and light
* Provides test report generation
* 0 dependencies
* Few assertions (easy to get used to) which still provides everything you need
